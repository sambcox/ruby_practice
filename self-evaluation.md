# Arrays Self-Evaluation
I feel very confident in what I have experienced so far, it all makes complete sense. What I will say is that I am aware of how little we have gone into about such a massive subject, so I am anxious/excited to learn more!

I don't have any additional learning I need to do yet. I would like to learn things as the instructors would like to teach them, so I know the right things at the right time and don't overwhelm myself.

I am very curious about how arrays can be automatically updated by a different program. For example, how new information is added to a string array when a new person signs up for a service.
